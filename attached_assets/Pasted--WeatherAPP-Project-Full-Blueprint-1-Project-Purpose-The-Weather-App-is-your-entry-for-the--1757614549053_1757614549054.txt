🌤 WeatherAPP Project — Full Blueprint
1. 🎯 Project Purpose

The Weather App is your entry for the Frontend Mentor 30-Day Hackathon. It must be completed by October 6th, 2025. The deliverables include:

A fully functional, responsive weather application built with a modern JavaScript framework (React/Next.js preferred).

Clean, documented GitHub repo with commits showing daily progress.

Netlify deployment with a live link.

Daily LinkedIn documentation posts + Discord updates to show consistency.

Final README.md + documentation explaining setup, features, and learnings.

2. 🖥️ Technical Stack

Frontend: React (or Next.js if you want routing/SSR)
Styling: CSS / TailwindCSS (your choice, but Tailwind = faster + clean design)
API: OpenWeatherMap API (or WeatherAPI)
Version Control: Git + GitHub
Deployment: Netlify

3. 📂 Repository Setup

Repo Name: WeatherAPP (already created)

Branching: Work on main branch, or optionally create feature branches (feature/search, feature/ui)

Commit style: Small, descriptive commits (e.g., feat: add weather search bar, fix: API error handling)

.gitignore: Node modules, build files, and environment files (.env)

4. 🚀 Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Setup & Deployment (Now–Sept 13)

Fix GitHub remote → connect repo properly

Initialize React project (npx create-react-app weatherapp or npx create-next-app@latest) inside repo

Commit & push boilerplate code → deploy to Netlify

Confirm live URL (e.g., https://weatherapp.netlify.app)

Deliverable: “Hello Weather” screen live

Phase 2: Core Features (Sept 14–Sept 24)

Search Functionality

Input for city name

API call to fetch data

Display city, country, current temperature, condition

Weather States

Loading animation

Error message if city not found

No results UI

Weather Cards

Today’s weather with icons (sunny, cloudy, rain, snow, etc.)

Forecast for next 3–5 days

Unit Toggle

Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit switch

Deliverable: Working app with core functionality

Phase 3: UI & Responsiveness (Sept 25–Oct 2)

Match Figma designs → pixel-perfect

Mobile-first → Desktop scaling

Implement hover states, focus states, transitions

Use weather icons from assets/images

Add branding (logo, favicon, title)

Deliverable: Fully styled, responsive app

Phase 4: Testing & Documentation (Oct 3–Oct 6)

Test across browsers and devices

Fix bugs (API edge cases, slow loading, etc.)

Write full README.md with:

Project overview

Features list

Installation steps (git clone, npm install, npm start)

Tech stack

Live demo link (Netlify)

Screenshots

Final Netlify deploy

Deliverable: Polished app, live + documented

## 6. 📝 Progress & Documentation Routine

### **Daily (LinkedIn & Discord)**  
- Post screenshot of progress  
- Add short caption: “Day X of WeatherAPP Hackathon → implemented [feature]”  
- Push commits to GitHub  

### **Weekly**  
- Write longer update post with learnings, blockers, solutions  
- Include demo link if stable  

### **Final Submission (Oct 6)**  
- Live demo link (Netlify)  
- GitHub repo with README & commits

---

## 7. 📊 Example Daily Commit Flow
```bash
# Work on feature
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add search bar + API call"
git push origin main

8. ✅ Success Criteria

By October 6th, you must have:

✅ Live deployed app on Netlify

✅ Clean GitHub repo with full README

✅ Core features (search, weather display, forecast, responsiveness)

✅ LinkedIn & Discord documentation trail

✅ Polished UI matching Figma

💡 This plan ensures:

You’re building steadily (not rushing at the end)

You have public documentation (LinkedIn/Discord) to prove consistency

You’ll have both technical delivery + branding impact
